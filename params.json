  "body": "### About Us\r\nWrenegade Kennels is an established and well regarded German Shorthair Pointer breeder in Iowa. Breeding since 1970 and winning National Amateur Championship & Open in 1972, we have been involved in the Eastern Iowa German Shorthair Club for many years. Having judged at all of the national championships over the years and winning with our dogs, we've seen a collection of the best shorthairs in the history of the breed, and our own bloodlines include multiple FC and NFC dogs. \r\n\r\nWrenegade Kennels breeds for style, class, excellent temperament, and early development. We have been a full service kennel for 40+ years offering stud services, puppies, as well as started and finished dogs.\r\n\r\nOur kennel has striven to make the most complete dogs for hunting and competition, and have been very successful in both. Careful consideration is given to each breeding to make sure that the sire and dam are complimentary and the pups are well matched to the personalities and needs of our clients. References are available and the birds in the bag speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Litters\r\nWrenegade Kennels accepts reservations for future litters.\r\nPlease call 319-827-1933 or email info@wrenegadekennels.com to discuss possible future breedings.",
