After retiring from the circuit we are relaxing hunting and fishing and continuing to raise quality shorthairs.\r\n\r\nFor the best results, hunt with the best, here are the results of hunts with Wrenegade dogs.\r\n![Bob with pheasants and quails](/images/IMG_20160424_0013.jpg)\r\n![Bob Dan and Rick](/images/IMG_20160424_0007.jpg)\r\n![Randy](/images/IMG_20160424_0008.jpg)\r\n![Bob and Dan](/images/IMG_20160424_0009.jpg)\r\n![Bagged birds](/images/IMG_20160424_0010.jpg)\r\n![More bagged birds](/images/IMG_20160424_0012.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Bloodlines bred to be the all around best\r\nWrenegade Kennels breeds for style, class, excellent temperament, and early development. We have been a full service kennel for 40+ years offering stud services, puppies, as well as started dogs.\r\n\r\nOur kennel has striven to make the most complete dogs for hunting and competition, and have been very successful in both. Careful consideration is given to each breeding to make sure that the sire and dam are complimentary and the pups are well matched to the personalities and needs of our clients. \r\n\r\n![Maggie and Lou](/images/Maggie and Jake.jpg)\r\nMaggie and Lou\r\n![Wrenegade's Strike 3](/images/Strike 3.jpg)\r\nWrenegade's Strike 3\r\n![Wrenegade's Willow the Wisp, daughter of Gusto](/images/Willow a Gus daughter.jpg)\r\nWrenegade's Willow the Wisp\r\n![Wrenegade's Cody, son of Gusto](/images/Cody a Gus son.jpg)\r\nWrenegade's Cody\r\n\r\nOur dogs have successfully hunted in Canada, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Montana, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa.\r\n![Wrenegade's Full of Gusto on point in South Dakota](/images/Full of Gusto - Working pheasants in south dakota.jpg)\r\nWrenegade's Full of Gusto\r\n \r\n### Upcoming Litters\r\n![Tony's son](/images/pup a Tony.jpg)\r\nTony's son\r\n<!-- Add picture of Ruby here -->\r\n\r\nExceptional customers have been the core of our business, and they come back every time they are in the market for a new dog.

I think there were 18 dogs entered - pointers, setters, brittanys and one GSP (Schoen). Pat Casey, a good friend, ran her. She won! Will send photos. \r\n- Bill Swan",
