<p>Having judged at all of the national championships over the years and winning with our dogs, we've seen a collection of the best shorthairs in the history of the breed, and our own bloodlines include multiple FC and NFC dogs. After retiring from the circuit we are relaxing hunting and fishing and continuing to raise quality shorthairs.

<p>Wrenegade Kennels breeds for style, class, excellent temperament, and early development. We have been a full service kennel for 40+ years offering stud services, puppies, as well as started dogs.

<p>Our kennel has striven to make the most complete dogs for hunting and competition, and have been very successful in both. Careful consideration is given to each breeding to make sure that the sire and dam are complimentary and the pups are well matched to the personalities and needs of our clients. 
Our motto has always been you should only hunt with the best. Our dogs have successfully hunted in Canada (Saskatchewan), Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Montana, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Iowa.

<p>Schoen ran in a field trial Saturday near South Hill, Va. Handlers on horseback. She ran in Derby (up to 2 yrs old). I think there were 18 dogs entered - pointers, setters, brittanys and one GSP (Schoen). Pat Casey, a good friend, ran her. She won! Will send photos. - Bill Swan</p>
