<p>Wrenegade Kennels is a well established German Shorthair Pointer breeder in Iowa. The breeding program at Wrenegade has been built from a collection of the best shorthairs in the history of the breed including multiple FC and NFC dogs. After decades of highly selective breeding Wrenegade is producing the champions and foundation stock for tomorrow. Wrenegade Kennels strives to produce well balanced dogs with unequaled natural ability in each litter. Careful consideration is given to each breeding to make sure that sires and dams are well matched to produce the caliber of dog that our customers expect. According to the AKC, Germans in the late 19th and early 20th century selectively bred the GSP for biddability, with steps taken later to improve stance, style, and nose in order to produce the quintessential field dog. At Wrenegade Kennels we continue to refine this breeding philosophy with an emphasis on adding natural intelligence and calm demeanor to the breeding criteria. Wrenegade German Shorthairs have been put to the test as high performance guide dogs, national competitors, and endurance athletes. When not in the field our dogs make excellent companions and have proven themselves to be loyal family pets. References are available but the best way to experience a Wrenegade German Shorthair Pointer for the first time is to book a hunt and watch them in action. We would love to show them off in the field and have them speak for themselves.</p>
